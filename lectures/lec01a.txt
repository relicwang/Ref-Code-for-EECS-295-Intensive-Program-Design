When you need to show up:
  - TuTh, in this room from 12 to 3
  - A half-hour codewalk, probably every Wednesday

Course staff:

  Instructors:
    - Jesse Tov, jesse@eecs
    - Robby Findler (out this week), robby@eecs

  TAs:
    - Dan Feltey, danielfeltey2015u

Homeworks:
  - Due every Tuesday evening
  - Pair programmed
  - Late homework won’t be accepted. Period.
  - Will be graded in codewalk on (probably) Wednesday
  - You will get check+, check, check-, or 0 in each of several categories
  - Your whole homework grade comes from the codewalk

Pair programming:
  - You will have a partner, probably assigned.
  - Your partner will change several times.
  - You must do all work in this course with your partner, pair
    programming.
  - This means you’re in the same place, one person typing (the pilot)
    and one person helping (the co-pilot). Switch frequently.
  - You will present together, and each of you is responsible for all
    the code.

Grading (tentative):
  - code walks: 70%
  - exam: 30%

Cheating
--------

  - You and your partner are jointly responsible for all code you turn
    in.
  - You cannot steal this code from other students or the web—you must
    write it yourself.
  - If you turn in stolen code, both you and your partner are
    responsible, even if your partner stole it and you didn’t know.
  - If you allow someone to steal your code, you are equally
    responsible.
  - Possible penalties range from a 0 on the stolen assignment to
    failing the class.
